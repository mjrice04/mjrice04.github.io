# Side Projects I'm Proud of
Most of my working hours are spent working on propreietary code for clients. If you want to get an idea of what I work on during working hours check out [About Me](/about-me.html). In my spare time I like to work on personal projects that put data to work or help me hone a particular skill set. I also like to make sure these projects are fun!

## Google Music Listening History Analysis
* **What:** A analysis on almost 8 years of listening to Google Music. 
* **Why:** This project was inspired by my jealousy of Spotify users getting cool summaries of their listening habits every year. I've been a dedicated user of Google Music since at least 2013. I learned there was an unoffical [Google Music API](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi) and I decided to pull my listening history to see what I could analyze. This project became more urgent when I learned Google Music was being shut down and I was not sure if I wanted to move to Youtube music. This analysis was fun but also serves as time capsule to my listening habits in my 20's.
* **Technology Used:** googlemusicapi, requests, pandas, jupyter
* **[Source Code](https://github.com/mjrice04/gmusic_history)**
* [See the analysis in a jupyter notebook](/google-music-analysis.html)

## Collecting Internet Speedtest data
* **What:** A simple script for running an internet speed test from the command line and collecting the results in a csv. This script leverages [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) to actually execute the speedtest.
* **Why:** I put together this project to collect evidence that my internet speed is much slower than I am currently paying for. I run this script in the background to collect my current internet download and upload speeds every 5 minutes and append the results to an existing csv. My long term plan is to turn this data into a live dashboard powered by Dash.
* **Technology Used:** pandas
* **[Source Code](https://github.com/mjrice04/collect_speedtest_data)**
* [See example data](https://github.com/mjrice04/collect_speedtest_data/blob/master/data/speedtest.csv)

## Pico Fermi Bagel
* **What:** A classic (*in my opinon*) number guessing game implemented in python with click. 
* **Why:** Pico Fermi Bagel is a number guessing game I used to play in elementary school. I decided to spend a couple of hours exercising my python muscles and implemented the game playable through the CLI. 
* **Technology Used:** click
* **[Source Code](https://github.com/mjrice04/pico_fermi_bagel)**
* [Play the game](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/matthewjrice44/shares/1a918f2ed1ca4021b564cdc79660acc0/) **Note that you need to setup a free Python Anywhere account to play the game**

## Today I Learned
* **What:** A collection of code snippets and concepts I've learned or looked up in my professional and personal coding projects.
* **Why:** Inspired by [https://github.com/jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and the movement for engineers to learn in public. I think it is important to learn in public and to dispel the myth that to be a software/data engineer you need to know every concept and piece of code. I look up snippets of code on StackOverflow and read documentation all the time! The bonus side effect of this repository is automatic documentation code snippets and concepts I might need on a future project. I hope to keep adding to this project throughout my career.
* **Technology Used:** git
